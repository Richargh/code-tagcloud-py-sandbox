= Code Tag Cloud (Sandbox)

== Features

* Python script that can generate word clouds from code. Implemented languages are:
** Java
** Kotlin
** C#
** TS/JS

== Prerequisites

=== Appropriate Python Version

Make sure an appropriate python version is installed. If you have link:https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv] installed, you can call:

* `pyenv local` (will install the version from link:.python-version[.python-version])

=== Setup Virtual Environment
1. Create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv venv` in the project directory.
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS and Linux, run `source venv/bin/activate`.
   - On macOS with fish shell, run `source venv/bin/activate.fish`.
   - On Windows, run `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.

=== Install Dependencies

Make sure all required dependencies are installed:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

== Usage

. Run the code with `./main.py samples/renting-java java all`
** Note that "all" seems to be the best option for now.
** Drill-downs with "behavior" or "type" seem to work way better in Java than in other languages.
. Run tests with `python -m unittest discover`.

=== Other repositories to tag cloud

== Pyenv vs Virtual Environment

* `pyenv` manages multiple versions of Python itself.
* `virtualenv/venv` manages virtual environments for a specific Python version.

== Created via

. `pip install wordcloud`
. `pip install pygments`
. `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
